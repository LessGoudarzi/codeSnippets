## Snippet Archiving

I often  find myself re-generating code that  I know I have already produced on another project.  As such, I am hoping to use this github to collect together various snippets of code that I can later use.

I often work with:

VBA, primarily for Excel but some with Word and Access
D3.js, a very powerful data visualiaztion package written in javascript

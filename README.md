## Snippet Archiving

I often  find myself re-generating code that  I know I have already produced on another project.  As such, I am hoping to use this github to collect together various snippets of code that I can later use.

I often work with:

* VBA, primarily for Excel but some with Word and Access  
* [D3.js](http://www.d3js.org), a very powerful data visualiaztion package written in javascript  
  * [Dimple.js](http://www.Dimplejs.org) an extension of D3.js
  * [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) another useful library of javascript
* [eViews](http://www.eviews.com/home.html), an eccnometric programming language

I plan on putting together alternative files that will share the various code snippets that I have found useful to re-use.

I will put links to the files here.

* [VBA](#vba-stuff)
* [D3JS](#d3-stuff)
* [eViews]
* [Other]

Each section that follows contains links to snippets in each language.

Any comments ar suggestions are welcome.
